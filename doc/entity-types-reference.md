# Entity Types Reference

`brains` stores durable knowledge as typed markdown entities. Each entity type is registered by an entity plugin, validated with Zod, indexed for search, exposed through system tools, and optionally rendered by the site builder.

## Storage conventions

Directory sync maps files in `brain-data/` to entities by path:

- root markdown files are note entities with `entityType: "base"`
- files under `brain-data/<entity-type>/` use that directory name as the entity type
- nested paths below the entity-type directory become colon-separated ids: `site-content/home/hero.md` becomes entity type `site-content` with id `home:hero`
- image files are supported under `brain-data/image/`

Most content entities use YAML frontmatter plus a markdown body:

```markdown
---
title: My first post
status: draft
---

Markdown body goes here.
```

Core fields such as `id`, `entityType`, `created`, `updated`, and the markdown body are managed by the runtime and adapters. Frontmatter fields are the user-editable fields for each type.

`all presets` means the entity type is available in every preset currently declared by that model. A type marked `opt-in` is registered as a capability but is not included in the model's preset list by default.

## Common authoring surfaces

You can create and update entities through several paths:

- chat or MCP clients using `system_create`, `system_update`, `system_delete`, `system_get`, `system_list`, `system_search`, `system_extract`, and `system_insights`
- the generated CMS when the CMS plugin is active
- direct edits to markdown files in `brain-data/` when `directory-sync` is active
- generation jobs owned by entity plugins, for example link capture, image generation, newsletter generation, and social-post generation

## Identity entities

### `brain-character`

Singleton file: `brain-data/brain-character/brain-character.md`

Defines the brain's display identity and behavioral center of gravity.

Key fields:

- `name`
- `role`
- `purpose`
- `values`

### `anchor-profile`

Singleton file: `brain-data/anchor-profile/anchor-profile.md`

Defines the public identity behind the brain. A2A and site surfaces can use this as profile data.

Key fields:

- `name`
- `kind`: `professional`, `team`, or `collective`
- `organization`
- `description`
- `avatar`
- `website`
- `email`
- `socialLinks`

## Core knowledge entities

### `base` — notes

Root-level markdown files in `brain-data/` become note entities.

Example paths:

```text
brain-data/README.md          # id: README, entityType: base
brain-data/research/idea.md   # id: research:idea, entityType: base
```

Key frontmatter:

- `title` optional; falls back to the first H1 or filename

Use notes for general knowledge, imported markdown, scratch material, and content that does not need a specialized workflow.

### `prompt`

Prompt entities customize named generation templates.

Example path:

```text
brain-data/prompt/blog-generation.md
```

Key frontmatter:

- `title`
- `target`: template name, such as `blog:generation` or `link:extraction`

### `link`

Link entities store captured web URLs and their extracted summaries.

Example path:

```text
brain-data/link/example-com-article.md
```

Key frontmatter:

- `status`: `pending`, `draft`, or `published`
- `title`
- `url`
- `description`
- `domain`
- `capturedAt`
- `source`: `{ ref, label }`

Creating a link with `system_create` and a `url` can enqueue the link-capture workflow instead of requiring hand-written frontmatter.

### `wish`

Wish entities capture requested capabilities or deferred user intents.

Key frontmatter:

- `title`
- `status`: `new`, `planned`, `in-progress`, `done`, or `declined`
- `priority`: `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `critical`
- `requested`: count of repeated requests
- `declinedReason`

## Derived knowledge entities

### `topic`

Topic entities are usually derived from published/source content. Rover extracts topics from posts, decks, projects, links, and the anchor profile by default. Relay extracts topics from its source corpus.

Key frontmatter/body:

- frontmatter `title`
- body `content`
- metadata `aliases` for canonicalization and merge reuse

### `skill`

Skill entities are derived from topic evidence and advertised through agent/A2A surfaces.

Key fields follow the shared skill data shape used by the plugin system.

### `swot`

SWOT entities are derived assessment outputs.

Key frontmatter:

- `strengths`
- `weaknesses`
- `opportunities`
- `threats`
- `derivedAt`

Each SWOT item has a `title` and optional `detail`.

### `summary`

Summary entities store conversation summaries when the summary plugin is enabled.

Key metadata:

- `conversationId`
- `channelName`
- `channelId`
- `interfaceType`
- `entryCount`
- `totalMessages`

The body contains chronological summary log entries.

## Publishing entities

### `site-info`

Singleton file: `brain-data/site-info/site-info.md`

Defines site-wide metadata.

Key body fields:

- `title`
- `description`
- `copyright`
- `logo`
- `themeMode`: `light` or `dark`
- `cta`: `{ heading, buttonText, buttonLink }`

### `site-content`

Route/section content used by configurable site packages.

Example path:

```text
brain-data/site-content/home/hero.md # id: home:hero
```

Key metadata:

- `routeId`
- `sectionId`
- optional `template`

### `doc`

Doc entities render documentation list/detail pages.

Key frontmatter:

- `title`
- `section`
- `order`
- `sourcePath`
- `description`
- `slug`

The body contains the documentation markdown.

### `image`

Image entities store binary image assets as data URLs in the database and as image files in `brain-data/image/` when synced.

Key metadata:

- `title`
- `alt`
- `format`: `png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `webp`, `gif`, or `svg`
- `width`
- `height`
- `sourceUrl`

Images are non-embeddable and are commonly referenced by `coverImageId` fields on posts, decks, projects, and social posts.

## Content and marketing entities

### `post`

Blog post entities render through the blog/site packages.

Key frontmatter:

- `title`
- `slug`
- `status`: `draft`, `queued`, or `published`
- `publishedAt`

- `author`
- `coverImageId`
- `seriesName`
- `seriesIndex`
- SEO fields: `ogImage`, `ogDescription`, `twitterCard`, `canonicalUrl`

- `did`
- `status`: `discovered` or `approved`
- `discoveredAt`

Parsed body sections include:

URL-based creation through `system_create` can fetch the agent card and create an approved saved agent entry.
