# brain.yaml Reference

`brain.yaml` is the instance-level configuration file for a brain. It selects the brain model, chooses a preset, overrides deployment settings, and passes config to plugins and interfaces.

Secrets should live in `.env` and be referenced with `${ENV_VAR}` interpolation.

## Example

```yaml
brain: rover
anchor: person
domain: mybrain.example.com
preset: core

admins: []
anchors: []

site:
  package: "@acme/brain-site"

plugins:
  # Uncomment to enable git-backed sync of brain content:
  # directory-sync:
  #   git:
  #     repo: your-org/brain-data
  #     authToken: ${GIT_SYNC_TOKEN}
  # Optional deprecated fallback for MCP clients that cannot use OAuth:
  # mcp:
  #   authToken: ${MCP_AUTH_TOKEN}
```

## Supported top-level fields

```yaml
brain: rover
anchor: person
site:
  package: "@acme/brain-site"
  theme: "@acme/brain-theme"
name: "My Brain"
logLevel: info

  # Optional deprecated fallback for MCP clients that cannot use OAuth:
  # mcp:
  #   authToken: ${MCP_AUTH_TOKEN}
permissions:
  admins:
    - "cli:*"

    summary:
      create: admin
      update: admin
      delete: admin
```

## Fields

### `brain` (required)

The brain model to run.

Accepted forms:

- bare built-in name, such as `rover`, `relay`, or `ranger`
- scoped package name, such as `@my-org/my-brain`
- legacy `@brains/rover`-style refs are still accepted for compatibility

### `anchor`

The Anchor profile flavor—the person, team, or organization this brain represents.

```yaml
anchor: person # person | team | organization
```

- `person` uses personal ownership. The represented person is also an active Admin.
- `team` and `organization` both use collective, impersonal ownership. No member has `isAnchor`; any active Admin administers the brain.
- `team` and `organization` differ only in profile shape and Admin-console vocabulary.

The value is configuration, not an Admin-console mutation. The Anchor's public name and profile remain CMS content in `anchor-profile/anchor-profile`; `/admin` displays that profile read-only and links to its CMS editor. Brain models provide backward-compatible defaults (`rover` → `person`, `relay` → `team`, `ranger` → `organization`), while generated instance configs declare the value explicitly.

### `site`

Optional site override.

```yaml
site:
  package: "@acme/brain-site"
  theme: "@acme/brain-theme"
```

Fields:

- `package` — site package to load
- `variant` — optional site-specific flavor string for packages that support it
- `theme` — base theme package or inline CSS string to use for styling
- `themeOverride` — extra CSS or a theme CSS package ref to append after the base theme

`site.package`, `site.theme`, and `site.themeOverride` are resolved independently. The site package stays structural-only; the theme is validated separately and injected into site-builder. `themeOverride` is additive, which lets an app-local `src/theme.css` extend a shared base theme without replacing it.

Use this when the brain model's built-in site package is not the one you want, when you want to pair the same site package with a different base theme, or when you want to layer local theme overrides on top of a shared theme.

### `name`

Optional instance name override.

### `logLevel`

Logging verbosity.

Allowed values:

- `debug`
- `info`
- `warn`
- `error`

### `logFile`

Optional log file path.

When set, logs are also written to disk. This is useful for usage tracking and postmortem debugging.

### `port`

Optional production port override.

### `domain`

Production domain for the instance.

Used for:

- canonical site URLs
- preview URL derivation
- A2A endpoint discovery
- CMS and webserver identity

### `database`

Database URL, usually SQLite.

Example:

```yaml
database: file:./data/brain.db
```

### `model`

Override the default AI model.

Examples:

```yaml
model: gpt-5.6-luna
model: claude-haiku-4-5
model: openai:gpt-4o-mini
```

The provider is inferred from the model name unless you prefix it explicitly.

### `reasoningEffort`

Set OpenAI reasoning effort. Supported values are `none`, `low`, `medium`,
`high`, `xhigh`, and `max`. Other providers ignore this setting.

```yaml
reasoningEffort: low
```

### `preset`

Select a curated subset of capabilities and interfaces defined by the brain model.

Current built-in presets:

| Brain model | Presets                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------- |
| `rover`     | `core`, `default`, `full` |
| `relay`     | `core`, `default`, `full` |
| `ranger`    | `default`                 |

If omitted, resolution falls back to the brain model's default preset behavior. In practice, it is best to set this explicitly.

### `mode`

Runtime mode override.

Currently supported:

- `eval` — disables side-effectful capabilities listed by the brain model's `evalDisable`

### `add` / `remove`

Refine the selected preset.

```yaml
preset: default
add:
  - stock-photo
remove:
  - discord
```

These entries refer to capability/interface ids from the brain model.

### `admins`

Top-level shorthand for caller identities with administrative permission.

```yaml
admins:
  - "discord:000000000000000000"
```

### `anchors`

Top-level shorthand for caller identities established as the brain's owner or subject in chat. Anchor identity does not grant permissions; list the same caller under `admins` as well when a personal Anchor should administer the brain.

### `trusted`

Top-level shorthand for elevated-access identities.

### `permissions`

Permission overrides.

`admins`, `trusted`, and `rules` control the caller permission level. `anchors` independently identifies callers who represent the brain's owner/subject in chat. `entityActions` controls which permission level is required to mutate each entity type through central system tools and publish pipeline commitments.

```yaml
permissions:
  entityActions:
    "*":
      create: trusted
      update: trusted
      delete: admin
      extract: trusted
      publish: admin
    post:
      update: trusted # collaborators may edit drafts
      publish: admin # only admins may publish/queue/schedule
    social-post:
      update: trusted
      publish: admin
    summary:
      create: admin
      update: admin
      delete: admin
```

Rules:

- supported actions are `create`, `update`, `delete`, `extract`, and `publish`;
- supported levels are `public`, `trusted`, `admin`, and `never`;
- `publish` gates publication commitments: publish-aware status transitions, direct publish calls, queue adds, scheduled execution, and send/publish handlers;
- `publish` must be at least as restrictive as `update` for the same entity type after wildcard inheritance and entity-specific overrides are merged;
- `never` forbids the action through system tools for every caller — useful for singleton identity/config entities that should not be deletable via the agent; internal plugin code can still mutate them directly;
- `"*"` is the default for entity types without an explicit entry;
- entity-specific entries override `"*"` per action;
- omitted actions inherit from `"*"`;
- if no `entityActions` policy is configured by the brain model or instance, existing mutation-tool behavior is preserved.

This policy is enforced by `system_create`, `system_update`, `system_delete`, topic extraction, and publish pipeline tools/handlers. It does not control read/search/list visibility; use entity visibility for read access.

### `plugins`

Per-plugin config overrides keyed by plugin/interface id.

```yaml
plugins:
  directory-sync:
    git:
      repo: your-org/brain-data
      authToken: ${GIT_SYNC_TOKEN}
  # Optional private libSQL primary for auth backup and provider-managed PITR:
  # auth-service:
  #   replica:
  #     syncUrl: ${AUTH_DATABASE_URL}
  #     authToken: ${AUTH_DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN}
  #     syncIntervalMs: 60000
  # Optional deprecated fallback for MCP clients that cannot use OAuth:
  # mcp:
  #   authToken: ${MCP_AUTH_TOKEN}
  discord:
    botToken: ${DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN}
```

These values are merged into the selected capability or interface config. When `auth-service` is enabled, HTTP MCP uses the built-in OAuth/passkey provider by default; set `plugins.mcp.authToken` only for non-OAuth clients or emergency static-token access.

`auth-service.replica` keeps `./data/auth/auth.db` as an embedded replica of a private remote libSQL primary. Startup performs an initial sync before migrations, and libSQL then syncs at the configured interval (60 seconds by default). Configure backup retention and point-in-time recovery on the remote provider. For an existing local database, stop the brain and import that database into the remote primary before enabling the replica; never point populated local auth state at an empty primary. The URL and token belong in secret-backed environment variables, never Git or `brain-data`.

External plugin packages use the same keyed map with a reserved `package` field and optional nested `config` object:

```yaml
plugins:
  calendar:
    package: "@rizom/brain-plugin-calendar"
    config:
      apiKey: ${CALENDAR_API_KEY}
      timezone: UTC
```

The package version belongs in the instance `package.json`; `brain.yaml` only declares and configures the plugin. List-form `plugins:` is not supported.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@rizom/brain-plugin-calendar": "^0.1.0"
  }
}
```

External plugin packages should declare their compatible runtime with a peer dependency:

```json
{
  "peerDependencies": {
    "@rizom/brain": "^0.2.0-alpha.47"
  }
}
```

### `permissions`

Explicit permission and Anchor identity configuration.

```yaml
permissions:
  admins:
    - "mcp:stdio"
  anchors:
    - "discord:000000000000000000"
  trusted:
    - "discord:123456789"
  rules:
    - pattern: "a2a:friendbrain"
      level: trusted
    - pattern: "a2a:*"
      level: public
```

Fields:

- `admins` — identities with administrative permission
- `anchors` — identities established as the brain's owner/subject in chat; this grants no permission
- `trusted` — identities with elevated collaboration permission
- `rules` — pattern-based permission rules

Allowed rule levels:

- `admin`
- `trusted`
- `public`

### Permission precedence

Permission config is merged in this order:

1. brain-model defaults
2. top-level `admins` / `anchors` / `trusted`
3. nested `permissions` block

So the nested `permissions` block wins over the top-level shorthand.

On first auth initialization, exact `admins`, `trusted`, and `anchors` entries are normalized, hashed, and seeded into private `auth.db`. Ordinary restarts load those DB rows and do not reapply later config edits. Use the Admin console Overview to manage labeled standalone exact grants; the supplied subject is hashed on write and never displayed again. Use `brain auth reinitialize-access --yes` for deliberate access recovery. Connected accounts take precedence over standalone exact grants. Pattern `rules` and shared-space selectors remain request-context configuration; the deprecated static MCP token remains a transport-level Admin fallback and never establishes Anchor identity.

## Environment variable interpolation

String values support `${ENV_VAR}` syntax.

```yaml
plugins:
  # Optional deprecated fallback for MCP clients that cannot use OAuth:
  # mcp:
  #   authToken: ${MCP_AUTH_TOKEN}
```

Notes:

- values are resolved from the environment at startup
- unset env vars are stripped out rather than left as literal strings
- empty YAML fields like `anchors:` are treated as absent values, not errors

## Common environment variables

| Variable            | Typical use                               |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `AI_API_KEY`        | Main AI provider key                      |
| `AI_IMAGE_KEY`      | Separate image-generation key             |
| `GIT_SYNC_TOKEN`    | Git-backed content sync                   |
| `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`    | Deprecated MCP HTTP static-token fallback |
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` | Discord bot interface                     |

## Deploy/bootstrap environment variables

These are not usually interpolated directly inside `brain.yaml`, but they show up in the deploy and bootstrap docs for `brain init <dir> --deploy` + `brain cert:bootstrap`.

| Variable                     | Typical use                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD`    | GHCR auth for Kamal                                     |
| `HCLOUD_TOKEN`               | Hetzner provisioning                                    |
| `HCLOUD_SSH_KEY_NAME`        | Hetzner SSH key registration name                       |
| `HCLOUD_SERVER_TYPE`         | Hetzner server type                                     |
| `HCLOUD_LOCATION`            | Hetzner location                                        |
| `KAMAL_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE` | Local source path for `brain ssh-key:bootstrap`         |
| `KAMAL_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`      | Deploy SSH private key stored in GitHub Actions secrets |
| `CF_API_TOKEN`               | Cloudflare API token for Origin CA bootstrap            |
| `CF_ZONE_ID`                 | Cloudflare zone ID for Origin CA bootstrap              |
| `CERTIFICATE_PEM`            | Origin CA certificate secret                            |
| `PRIVATE_KEY_PEM`            | Origin CA private key secret                            |

## Examples

### Minimal rover instance

```yaml
brain: rover
preset: core

admins: []
anchors: []

plugins: {}
```

HTTP MCP uses the built-in OAuth/passkey provider when the model includes `auth-service`. Add `plugins.mcp.authToken` only as a deprecated fallback for non-OAuth clients.

### Public rover instance with site + sync

```yaml
brain: rover
domain: mybrain.example.com
preset: full

site:
  package: "@acme/brain-site"

admins:
  - "discord:000000000000000000"
anchors:
  - "discord:000000000000000000"

plugins:
  directory-sync:
    git:
      repo: your-org/brain-data
      authToken: ${GIT_SYNC_TOKEN}
  # Optional deprecated fallback for non-OAuth MCP clients:
  # mcp:
  #   authToken: ${MCP_AUTH_TOKEN}
  discord:
    botToken: ${DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN}
```

### Relay instance with explicit permissions

```yaml
brain: relay
domain: team.example.com
preset: default

permissions:
  admins:
    - "cli:*"
  rules:
    - pattern: "a2a:*"
      level: public

plugins:
  # Optional deprecated fallback for non-OAuth MCP clients:
  # mcp:
  #   authToken: ${MCP_AUTH_TOKEN}
```

### Ranger instance using the shared Rizom site core

```yaml
brain: ranger
preset: default
domain: rizom.ai

site:
  package: "@acme/rizom-site"
  theme: "@acme/rizom-theme"

plugins:
  # Optional deprecated fallback for non-OAuth MCP clients:
  # mcp:
  #   authToken: ${MCP_AUTH_TOKEN}
```
