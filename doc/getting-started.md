# Getting Started

## What is a Brain?

A brain is an AI assistant that works with markdown files you own. It can search and update those files, expose tools to MCP clients such as Claude or Cursor, and optionally publish a website from the same content.

Out of the box, a brain can:

- keep content as markdown files in `brain-data/`
- expose tools and resources over MCP
- serve a static site and CMS
- sync content to git
- talk to AI providers through one runtime
- connect to additional surfaces such as Discord or A2A

Brains currently come in three model flavors:

- **Rover** — personal publishing + knowledge management
- **Relay** — team/shared knowledge workflows
- **Ranger** — collective/discovery-oriented brains

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) `>= 1.3.3`
- [Git](https://git-scm.com) if you want git-backed content sync
- An AI provider key exposed as `AI_API_KEY`

Optional:

- a GitHub repo for `directory-sync`
- a Discord bot token for the Discord interface
- a domain + server if you want to deploy publicly

## Quick start

```bash
# Install the CLI
bun add -g @rizom/brain

# Scaffold a new brain
brain init mybrain
cd mybrain

# Add your AI key
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env and set AI_API_KEY

# Start the brain
brain start
```

The generated `brain.yaml` defaults to `preset: core`, which is the minimal, usable on-ramp.

On first start, Rover and other models that include `auth-service` print a one-shot `/setup` URL. Open it locally and register a passkey. That passkey is your operator login for browser routes and OAuth-capable MCP clients. Auth state is stored under `./data/auth` by default; keep it outside `brain-data/` and preserve it across deploys.

## What `brain init` creates

A new brain instance is a small project directory. It carries the files needed for local execution and optional deploy scaffolding.

Typical scaffold:

```text
mybrain/
  brain.yaml        # instance configuration
  package.json      # pins @rizom/brain + preact for local execution
  README.md         # local quickstart notes
  .env.example      # environment variables to fill in
  .gitignore        # ignores .env, cache, build artifacts
  tsconfig.json     # JSX runtime hints for Preact-based site code
```

Some models also scaffold local site/theme authoring files:

```text
mybrain/
  src/site.ts       # local site composition built on @rizom/brain/site
  src/theme.css     # additive local theme override
```

When these files exist, `src/theme.css` layers on top of the active base theme. A local `src/site.ts` is discovered by convention when `brain.yaml` does not set `site.package`.

With `--deploy`, the scaffold also includes deployment helpers for the Kamal flow: `config/deploy.yml`, `.kamal/hooks/pre-deploy`, `deploy/Dockerfile`, `.github/workflows/publish-image.yml`, and `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. The generated `.env.schema` defaults to `--backend none`, which means varlock validates and normalizes values supplied directly from local env files or GitHub Actions secrets.

The proven operator flow is:

1. set local deploy values in `.env.local`
2. set `KAMAL_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE=~/.ssh/<site>_deploy_ed25519`
3. run `brain ssh-key:bootstrap --push-to gh`
4. run `brain secrets:push --push-to gh --dry-run`
5. run `brain secrets:push --push-to gh`
6. run `brain cert:bootstrap --push-to gh`
7. push to `main` so `Publish Image` and then `Deploy` run in GitHub Actions

After `brain init`, you can either:

- keep using the globally installed `brain` command immediately, or
- run `bun install` in the new directory and then use `bunx brain start` / `bun run start` against the pinned local version

## Init options

```bash
brain init <directory> [options]

Options:
  --model <name>         Brain model: rover (default), relay, ranger
  --domain <domain>      Production domain
  --content-repo <repo>  Git repo for content sync
  --backend <name>       Secret backend plugin (default: none)
  --deploy               Include deployment scaffolding
  --regen                Refresh generated deploy scaffolding files
  --ai-api-key <key>     Write an initial .env with AI_API_KEY
  --no-interactive       Skip prompts and use supplied/default values
```

## Configuration

All instance-specific configuration lives in `brain.yaml`.

Minimal example:

```yaml
brain: rover
domain: mybrain.example.com
preset: core

anchors: []

plugins:
  # Uncomment to enable git-backed content sync:
  # directory-sync:
  #   git:
  #     repo: your-org/brain-data
  #     authToken: ${GIT_SYNC_TOKEN}
  # Optional deprecated fallback for MCP clients that cannot do OAuth:
  # mcp:
  #   authToken: ${MCP_AUTH_TOKEN}
```

Secrets are referenced with `${ENV_VAR}` interpolation and loaded from `.env`. New MCP HTTP clients should prefer the built-in OAuth/passkey flow instead of `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`.

For the full schema, see [brain.yaml Reference](/docs/brain-yaml-reference).

## Interfaces

Once running, a brain can be accessed through several surfaces depending on the selected model and configured plugins.

| Interface     | Access                                              | Notes                                                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Web**       | `http://localhost:8080`                             | Shared HTTP surface: site, CMS, dashboard, API routes             |
| **MCP**       | stdio or `http://localhost:8080/mcp`                | HTTP MCP uses brain OAuth/passkeys when `auth-service` is enabled |
| **Chat REPL** | `brain chat`                                        | Local terminal conversation loop                                  |
| **Discord**   | Bot in a server                                     | Requires Discord credentials                                      |
| **A2A**       | `http://localhost:8080/.well-known/agent-card.json` | Agent-to-agent protocol                                           |
