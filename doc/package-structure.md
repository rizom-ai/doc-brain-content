# Package Structure

## Overview

The Brains repository is a monorepo with 8 workspace directories (`shell/`, `shared/`, `entities/`, `plugins/`, `interfaces/`, `sites/`, `brains/`, `packages/`). Each directory has a clear role in the architecture.

```
brains/
├── shell/              # Core infrastructure & services
├── shared/             # Shared utilities, themes, UI components
├── entities/           # Content type definitions (entity plugins)
├── plugins/            # Service plugins (tools + integrations)
├── interfaces/         # User interaction layers (chat, web, MCP)
├── sites/              # Structural site packages (composition + routes + plugins)
├── brains/             # Brain model definitions
└── packages/           # Standalone npm packages (brain-cli → @rizom/brain)
```

`apps/` is **not** a workspace category. Each `apps/<name>/` is a lightweight instance package centered on `brain.yaml`, with conventional support files like `.env`, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, and optional deploy artifacts, consumed by the `brain` CLI at runtime against the brain model package it references.

## Entities (EntityPlugin — content type definitions)

Entity plugins define content types with schemas, adapters, generation handlers, and datasources. They expose no tools — all CRUD goes through `system_create/update/delete`.

| Package                        | Purpose                                                           |

## Plugins (ServicePlugin — tools + infrastructure)

Plugins that provide MCP tools, orchestration, or infrastructure operations.

| Package                    | Purpose                                                      |

| `interfaces/a2a`       | Agent-to-Agent JSON-RPC (Agent Card, non-blocking tasks)                            |

## Sites

Site packages are structural-only bundles: layouts, routes, site plugins, entity display metadata, and static assets. Themes live separately under `shared/theme-*` and are selected alongside the site in `brain.yaml`.

| Package              | Purpose                                                                          |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sites/default`      | Default structural site for rover, typically paired with `@brains/theme-default` |
| `sites/personal`     | Personal site composition, blog-focused                                          |
| `sites/professional` | Professional site composition, editorial + portfolio + decks                     |
| `sites/rizom`        | Shared Rizom site core composed by the Rizom app instances                       |

## Brains

Brain models define what a brain IS — capabilities, interfaces, presets, identity.

| Package         | Purpose                                                                                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `brains/rover`  | Reference brain model. Personal knowledge + professional content. Published as docker image and npm package. |
| `brains/ranger` | Internal brain model used by the extracted `rizom.ai` app. Public source, no published artifacts.            |
| `brains/relay`  | Internal brain model used by the extracted `rizom.foundation` app. Public source, no published artifacts.    |

## Packages

Standalone published packages.

| Package               | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `packages/brain-cli`  | `@rizom/brain` — the published CLI: `brain init`, `brain start`, `brain diagnostics`, `brain eval`, `brain pin`. Bundles the runtime while `brain init` scaffolds the instance-local support files an app needs. |
| `packages/brains-ops` | `@rizom/ops` — operator CLI for managing rover-pilot fleets: wildcard TLS bootstrap, age-encrypted per-user secrets, content repo auto-create, multi-user deploy management.                                     |

## Apps (lightweight instance packages, NOT a workspace category)

Deployable Rizom app instances live in standalone repos (`rizom.ai`, `rizom.foundation`, `rizom.work`, `mylittlephoney`, and `yeehaa.io`). Shared site/theme/model packages stay in this monorepo and are consumed by those app repos through the published runtime packages. The `apps/<name>/` directories that remain here hold local runtime data (caches, brain-data) for development against extracted instances; they are not workspace packages.
